Intro
state of the art so far: organization-focused approach.*

*Theoretical and empirical advancement of the field of PR studies is somethimes limited by the scope of studies that are typically conducted. In particular, we made two observations. First, most studies take an organizational perspective. Secondly, the field still relies mainly on traditional research methods that do not scale well: surveying twice as much persons or analyzing twice as much documents is in essence roughly twice as expensive, because the work is done manually. We argue that by shifting towards a network perspecitve that emphasizes the role of very different types of nodes (ressources, stakeholders, ...) and the edges between them, a more comprehensive understanding of PR can be achieved. However, empirical observations that go beyond the study of small parts of such extended networks are difficult to achieve with many traditional research methods. Therefore, in this chapter, we sketch how so-called Big Data methods can be used to study the networks organizations operate in, thereby advancing knoweldge about PR.*

###	consequence hereof:
-	empirical and theoretical focus on a single organization (case study approach)
-	overlooking broader networks and connections between organizations.

###	solution:
-	approaching organisations from a macro-level perspective, appreciating them in interrelation
with other actors.
-	including communication theories are needed to handle the 'big data' issues that accompany
such a macro-level approach. 

## Theory

### Theoretical approaches that could guide the application of big-data in a macro-level approach 
to corporate communication.

*What's Big Data? While Big Data is an often-abused buzzword, there are some attempts to define it can actually help us to stipulate research directions for PR research. For instace, the often-used 3V-definition (REF) refers to volume, velocity, and variety of the data. This already indicates that Big Data is not only about its size (after all, what's big today might be small tomorrow), but also about the velocity with which new data arrive (real-time character), and the variety of data that can be used (e.g., policy documents, media coverage, statistics, etc.).
As the literature on Computational Social Science (e.g., REF_KITCHIN) has pointed out, it is a misconception that the use of Big Data techniques is inherently atheoretical. In contrast, using techniques to process data that are too volominous, change too fast, and are too varied to be analyzed by humans in a meaningful way can help both with theory-building and theory-testing.*

## Agenda
Responsible: **anne** & **toni**
  * moving away from uni-directional effects, moving towards a more complex understanding of effects between
organisations and societal actors (e.g., reversed agenda setting)
  * Organisaties in een SCR —> aantal nodes in een netwerk onderschat
  * beleidstukken —> aantal vrouwelijke werknemers, overtijds-perspectief
  * vragen die voorheen niet aan bod zijn gekomen
