## Intro

Organizations’ environments are constantly changing. The introduction of a new policy, the outburst of a crisis, or shifting behaviours of key stakeholders – such as competitors, publics and the media – all significantly affect trading conditions. Organizations’ survival depends upon their ability to anticipate and adequately respond to changes in this dynamic environment. In sum, the characteristics of the organizational environment by and large mandate individual organizational behaviour. 
In this Chapter, we argue that a macro-level approach to organizations is crucial to our understanding of organizational communication. More specifically, it is argued that by shifting towards a network perspective emphasizing the role of different types of nodes (such as resources, stakeholders, and events) – as well as the edges between them –, a more comprehensive understanding of corporate communication can be achieved. In this chapter, we sketch how so-called Big Data methods can be used to study the networks organizations operate in, thereby advancing knowledge about corporate communication.
We contribute to the literature on corporate communication in two ways. First, the majority of studies in the field has adopted an organizational-centric focus. For example, most literature on strategic communication and stakeholder-management has approached corporate communication from the perspective of the individual organization. This literature has added significantly to our understanding of the determinants of corporate communication on both the micro- and meso-level, but has neglected the influence of fluctuations in the broader environment in which organizations operate. Secondly, the field has relied primarily on case studies or small-scale content analysis. By linking large-scale automated content analysis data with macro-level indicators (such as market indicators and the occurrence of key events), the here-presented approach acknowledging additional sources of variation in corporate communication. 


~~Theoretical and empirical advancement of the field of PR studies is somethimes limited by the scope of studies that are typically conducted. In particular, we made two observations. First, most studies take an *organizational* perspective. 
Secondly, the field still relies mainly on traditional research methods that do not *scale* well: surveying twice as much persons or analyzing twice as much documents is in essence roughly twice as expensive, because the work is done manually.
We argue that by shifting towards a network perspecitve that emphasizes the role of very different types of nodes (ressources, stakeholders, ...) and the edges between them, a more comprehensive understanding of PR can be achieved. However, empirical observations that go beyond the study of small parts of such extended networks are difficult to achieve with many traditional research methods. 
Therefore, in this chapter, we sketch how so-called Big Data methods can be used to study the networks organizations operate in, thereby advancing knoweldge about PR.~~

## What's Big Data?
While Big Data is an often-abused buzzword, there are some attempts to define it can actually help us to stipulate research directions for PR research. For instace, the often-used 3V-definition (REF) refers to volume, velocity, and variety of the data. This already indicates that Big Data is not only about its size (after all, what's big today might be small tomorrow), but also about the velocity with which new data arrive (real-time character), and the variety of data that can be used (e.g., policy documents, media coverage, statistics, etc.). 

As the literature on Computational Social Science (e.g., REF_KITCHIN) has pointed out, it is a misconception that the use of Big Data techniques is inherently atheoretical. In contrast, using techniques to process data that are too volominous, change too fast, and are too varied to be analyzed by humans in a meaningful way can help both with theory-building and theory-testing.
