Given your background, we invite you to write about big data, multi-actor theory and PR in one of two approaches. The first type of chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical perspective, the current knowledge and empirical results in the specific theory and the applicability to PR/CorpComs. We would like to ask you to reflect on where the research agenda is likely to advance in the future. The second type of chapter provides an overview of the media effect theory and then applies the theory to the field of PR/CorpComs.

The chapter should be between 5000 and 8000 words and would use APA referencing style. Each contributor should send a 1000 word abstract of the chapter by May 15, 2017. The deadline for the first completed draft is August 1, 2017 followed be a peer-review process until October, 4, 2017. The deadline for the second draft is December 4, 2017. The deadline for the whole manuscript, as agreed with Routledge, is March 1, 2018. We expect a 2019 publication date.
